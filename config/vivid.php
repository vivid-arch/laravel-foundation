    | Add here the Device Service Providers that you would like to load.
    |
    | You can also toggle which devices will be loaded by the application
    | by adding true of false to each device. For example:
    |
    | Will be registred:
    | 'devices' => [
    |       'App\Devices\Example1\Providers\ExampleServiceProvider'
    |       'App\Devices\Example2\Providers\ExampleServiceProvider' => true
    | ]
    |
    | Will not be registred:
    | 'devices' => [
    |       'App\Devices\Example1\Providers\ExampleServiceProvider' => false
    | ]
    |
    | TIP: You can also use env variables to controll how and when the devices
    | will be loaded. For example you can disable certain devices on certain enviroments!
